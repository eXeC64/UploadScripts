Upload Scripts
==============

These are some helper scripts I use for uploading data to various upload
services.

MediaCrush
----------

Usage: `./scrush.sh` then select screen region and it'll open the mediacrush
page in your browser if it worked.

Paste.pm
--------

Usage: `echo "text" | ./ppm.sh` and it'll open the paste.pm page in your
browser if it worked.

Alternative usage: `cat file | ./ppm.sh`
